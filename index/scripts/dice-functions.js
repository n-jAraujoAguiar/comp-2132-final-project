DICE GAME REQUIREMENTS
    Create a dice game where a user plays against the computer. The user and the computer eachroll a pair of dice 3 times. After the third roll of the dice the player with highest score wins.

    The scoring for the game works as follows:
    - If any of the players two dice comes up as a 1 then the score for that round for the playeris 0. eg: if the player rolls a 6 and 1, they get a score of 0
    - If the player rolls a pair of the same numbers then the players score is the total of thetwo dice times 2. eg: if he player rolls 5 and 5, they get a score of (5+5)*2=20
    - If the player rolls any other combination of dice other than the ones mentioned abovethen the players score is the total value of the two dice, eg: player rolls a 3 and 2, playergets a score of 3+2=5
    
    The game should provide a text or graphical output showing the following:
    - The current rolled dice values for the player and the computer.
    - The score for this round for the player and the computer.
    - The accumulated total score for the player and computer
    
    The game should provide a button that will do the following: roll a pair dice for the player and another pair of dice for the computer, calculate the score for each of the playerâ€™s then update the browser display to reflect the state of the game.
    
    After three rolls of the dice the game should total up the scores and display a message displaying who the winner was.
    
    The game should provide a button that will reset the game and start a new game

This I am having trouble with:
    Line 42: how do I send parameters to requestAnimationFrame? using "function()" instead of "function" calls it only once.
